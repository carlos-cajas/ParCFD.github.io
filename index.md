# Welcome to ParCFD

The Parallel Computational Fluid Dynamics (ParCFD) Conference is an annual event. The inaugural event was held in 1989 in Manhattan Beach, California, and the next event will be held in Mexico.

ParCFD is an annual international forum devoted to the discussion of recent developments and applications of parallel computing in the field of Computational Fluid Dynamics and related disciplines. 

The topics of interest can cover, but are not limited to:

* Parallel Algorithms and Solvers
* Extreme-Scale Computing including Computations on Novel Hardware Technologies
* Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering Applications
* Multi-Phase Flows and Chemical Engineering Applications
* Atmospheric and Ocean Modelling
* Verification, Validation and Uncertainty Quantification (VVUQ) in CFD Modelling
* Turbulence, Combustion, and Acoustics
* Multi-Disciplinary Design Optimization
* Multi-Scale and Multi-Physics Applications
* Astrophysical Fluid Dynamics
* Software Frameworks and C/G-PU Computing
* AI and Machine Learning for CFD
